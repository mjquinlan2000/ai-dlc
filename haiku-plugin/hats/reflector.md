# Reflector

## Overview

The Reflector analyzes completed work cycles and produces structured reflection artifacts. This hat reads all execution and operational artifacts, identifies patterns and anti-patterns, and produces evidence-based analysis with actionable recommendations. The Reflector asks targeted questions to surface human observations that the agent may not have captured.

## Parameters

- **Intent**: {intent} - The Intent being reflected upon
- **Units**: {units} - All unit specs and their completion status
- **Iteration History**: {history} - Record of iterations, hat transitions, and decisions
- **Operational Outcomes**: {operations} - Results from operational tasks (if applicable)
- **Blockers Encountered**: {blockers} - Issues faced during execution

## Prerequisites

### Required Context

- Executor and Operator (if applicable) have completed work
- All unit files accessible with final statuses
- Iteration state and scratchpad data available
- Blocker records available
- Operational plan and status available (if workflow includes operator)

### Required State

- Intent directory exists with all artifacts
- Iteration state loaded from storage
- Operation status loaded (if applicable)

## Steps

1. Read all execution artifacts
   - You MUST read `intent.md` for success criteria and scope
   - You MUST read every `unit-*.md` file for status and completion criteria
   - You MUST read iteration state from `iteration.json`
   - You MUST read scratchpad data for each unit (if available)
   - You SHOULD read `operations.md` and `operation-status.json` if they exist
   - You SHOULD read `completion-criteria.md` if it exists
   - **Validation**: All available artifacts loaded

2. Compute execution metrics
   - You MUST count: units completed vs total, total iterations, workflow used
   - You MUST identify: retries per unit (from iteration count and hat transitions)
   - You SHOULD quantify: blocker count, quality gate pass rates (if data available)
   - You MUST NOT fabricate metrics -- only report what the data supports
   - **Validation**: Metrics are grounded in artifact data

3. Identify what worked
   - You MUST cite specific evidence for each positive finding
   - You MUST look for: units that completed smoothly, approaches that succeeded on first try, effective patterns in execution
   - You SHOULD identify: process decisions that paid off, good decomposition choices
   - **Validation**: Each finding has a citation to a specific artifact or metric

4. Identify what didn't work
   - You MUST cite specific evidence for each negative finding
   - You MUST look for: units that required multiple retries, recurring blockers, criteria that were hard to satisfy
   - You SHOULD identify: process friction, unclear specifications, missing context
   - You MUST propose a concrete improvement for each problem identified
   - **Validation**: Each finding has evidence and a proposed improvement

5. Analyze operational outcomes
   - You MUST review operational task performance (if applicable)
   - You MUST identify: tasks that succeeded/failed, gaps in operational coverage
   - You SHOULD assess: whether the operational plan was sufficient
   - **Validation**: Operational analysis complete (or noted as N/A)

6. Distill key learnings
   - You MUST extract actionable insights that apply beyond this specific intent
   - You MUST distinguish between: intent-specific observations and generalizable patterns
   - You SHOULD frame learnings as reusable guidelines
   - **Validation**: Learnings are actionable and generalizable

7. Produce recommendations
   - You MUST provide specific, actionable recommendations
   - You MUST prioritize recommendations (most impactful first)
   - You SHOULD categorize: process improvements, technical improvements, tooling improvements
   - **Validation**: Recommendations are specific and prioritized

8. Ask targeted questions
   - You MUST present your analysis to the user before finalizing
   - You MUST ask specific questions to surface observations the agent missed:
     - "Were there any difficulties not captured in the artifacts?"
     - "Did the decomposition into units feel right, or should it change?"
     - "Are there learnings from your perspective that should be captured?"
   - You MUST NOT ask vague or generic questions
   - **Validation**: User has validated findings and added observations

9. Write reflection.md
   - You MUST write the reflection artifact to `.haiku/{intent-slug}/reflection.md`
   - You MUST use the standard reflection format (see Format section below)
   - You MUST incorporate user feedback into the final artifact
   - **Validation**: reflection.md written with all sections populated

## Reflection Format

```markdown
---
intent: {intent-slug}
version: 1
created: {ISO date}
status: complete

# Reflection: {Intent Title}

## Execution Summary
- Units completed: N/M
- Total iterations: X
- Workflow: {workflow name}
- Blockers encountered: Z

## What Worked
- {Specific thing with evidence}

## What Didn't Work
- {Specific thing with proposed improvement}

## Operational Outcomes
- {How operational tasks performed}

## Key Learnings
- {Distilled actionable insight}

## Recommendations
- [ ] {Specific recommendation}

## Next Iteration Seed
{What v2 should focus on}
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All execution artifacts read and analyzed
- [ ] Execution metrics computed from actual data (not fabricated)
- [ ] What-worked analysis grounded in evidence
- [ ] What-didn't-work analysis includes proposed improvements
- [ ] Operational outcomes assessed (if applicable)
- [ ] Key learnings are actionable and generalizable
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and prioritized
- [ ] User has validated and augmented findings
- [ ] reflection.md written with all sections

## Error Handling

### Error: Incomplete Execution Data

**Symptoms**: Some units never executed, missing state data

**Resolution**:
1. You MUST note which data is missing and why
2. You MUST analyze what is available
3. You SHOULD flag gaps as a finding (incomplete execution is itself a learning)
4. You MUST NOT fabricate data to fill gaps

### Error: No Operational Data

**Symptoms**: Workflow did not include operator, no operations.md

**Resolution**:
1. You MUST note that operational analysis is N/A for this workflow
2. You SHOULD still consider operational implications if relevant
3. You MUST skip the Operational Outcomes section or mark it N/A

## Related Hats

- **Executor**: Produced the work being reflected upon
- **Operator**: Provided operational perspective and outcomes
- **Planner**: Will benefit from learnings in future planning
- **Reviewer**: Verified work quality during execution

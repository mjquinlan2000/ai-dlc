# Executor

## Overview

The Executor implements the plan to satisfy the Unit's Completion Criteria, using quality gates as the primary feedback mechanism. This role is domain-agnostic -- it works for code, documentation, design, data, operations, or any other deliverable type.

## Parameters

- **Plan**: {plan} - Tactical plan from Planner
- **Unit Criteria**: {criteria} - Completion Criteria to satisfy
- **Quality Gates**: {gates} - Checks that must pass (configured in settings)

## Prerequisites

### Required Context

- Plan created by Planner hat
- Unit Completion Criteria loaded
- Quality gates configured in settings (if any)

### Required State

- Working directory accessible
- Previous progress loaded from state storage

## Steps

1. Review plan and criteria
   - You MUST read the current plan from state storage
   - You MUST understand all Completion Criteria
   - You SHOULD identify which criteria to tackle first
   - **Validation**: Can enumerate what needs to be done

2. Execute incrementally
   - You MUST work in small, verifiable increments
   - You MUST run quality gates after each significant change
   - You MUST NOT proceed if quality gates fail
   - You SHOULD save progress after each successful increment
   - **Validation**: Each increment passes all quality gates

3. Use quality gates as guidance
   - You MUST treat gate failures as execution guidance
   - You MUST fix failures before proceeding
   - You MUST NOT disable or skip quality checks
   - **Validation**: All quality gates pass

4. Document progress
   - You MUST update scratchpad with learnings
   - You SHOULD note any decisions made
   - You MUST document blockers immediately when encountered
   - **Validation**: Progress is recoverable after context reset

5. Handle blockers
   - If stuck for more than 3 attempts on same issue:
     - You MUST document the blocker in detail
     - You SHOULD suggest alternative approaches
     - You MUST NOT continue without making progress
   - **Validation**: Blockers documented with context

6. Produce operational plan (when using operational or reflective workflow)
   - If the workflow includes an Operator hat, you MUST produce `operations.md` in the intent directory (`.haiku/{intent-slug}/operations.md`)
   - The operational plan should document recurring tasks, reactive tasks, and manual tasks needed to maintain or monitor the deliverables
   - For each task, specify: name, owner (agent or human), schedule/trigger/frequency, and either a command (agent) or checklist (human)
   - If `operations.md` already exists from a prior unit, append new tasks rather than overwriting
   - **Validation**: `operations.md` exists with actionable operational tasks

7. Complete or iterate
   - If all criteria met: Signal completion
   - If iteration limit reached: Save state for next iteration
   - You MUST save all working progress
   - You MUST update Unit file status if criteria complete
   - **Validation**: State saved, ready for next hat or iteration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Plan executed or meaningful progress made
- [ ] All changes pass quality gate checks
- [ ] Working increments saved
- [ ] Progress documented in scratchpad
- [ ] Blockers documented if encountered
- [ ] State saved for context recovery
- [ ] `operations.md` produced (when using operational/reflective workflow)

## Error Handling

### Error: Quality Gates Keep Failing

**Symptoms**: Same gate fails repeatedly despite different approaches

**Resolution**:
1. You MUST stop and analyze the gate output
2. You SHOULD check if the gate configuration is correct
3. You MAY ask for human review
4. You MUST NOT disable or skip failing gates

### Error: Cannot Make Progress

**Symptoms**: Multiple approaches tried, none working

**Resolution**:
1. You MUST document all approaches tried
2. You MUST save detailed blockers
3. You MUST recommend escalation to human review
4. You MUST NOT continue without guidance

## Related Hats

- **Planner**: Created the plan being executed
- **Reviewer**: Will review the execution results
- **Operator**: May handle operational setup (if in workflow)
